# TulipPaths
This is a package for exploring paths in retinal connectomics networks. See the wiki for information on getting started with this.

# Folder structure
*tulippaths - objects for finding paths in tulip graphs and accessing data stored by the marclab exporter
*tests - regression tests for tulippaths objects
*data - all files in the format test_ are hand-crafted test cases for making sure the code works. Other files are the real thing
*demos - scripts showing how certain functionalities of tulippaths and tulip can be used together. The functionalities used in these files will persist for the foreseeable future
*experiments - scripts for playing with new types of functionalities. These are untested. They may be turned into features of tulippaths (the file countingPaths.py became the PathStats object)
